# Ground Truth API
This is the home of the Ground Truth API.

## Mission
**Ground Truth gives everyone the opportunity to report their symptoms anonymously for the benefit of others. Our mission is to map the movement of infection and disease across the world, and provide unrestricted access to this data.**

## What is Ground Truth?
Ground Truth is a suite of apps and services that aim to crowd-source symptom data for the benefit of others. The data captured is free for anyone to read and use in their research or systems. Ground Truth is a data tool, and is not interested in capturing any possibly personally identifying information.

## What could Ground Truth be used for?
Here's just a few ideas:

üåç Using computer programming or AI / ML models to map the movement of symptoms across the globe

üö® Using the platform as an early warning system in developing countries

üöë Essential supplies / logistical planning by using the system to find out where the most help might be needed

## Where can i get the data?
There are several endpoints that power the webapp, the iOS and Android apps.

GET [https://api.groundtruth.app/hotspots](https://api.groundtruth.app/hotspots)
Returns a JSON array of hotspot objects. A "hotspot" is simply a report received from n anonymous Ground Truth user.

GET [https://api.groundtruth.app/layers](https://api.groundtruth.app/layers)
Returns a JSON array of layer objects. A "layer" is an information layer for a particular symptom, such as a "sneeze" or a "cough". Every hotspot is associated to a layer.

GET [https://api.groundtruth.app/statistics](https://api.groundtruth.app/statistics)
Returns a JSON array of statistic objects that provide surface counts for database entries.
